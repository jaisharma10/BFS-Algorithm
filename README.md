# Breath First Search [BFS] Algorithm

#### Task:

Implement Breath First Search [BFS] algorithm on an empty 10 x 10 map between a given start and goal node
        
#### Path is visualized using pygame. 
- Start Node is Red
- Goal Node is Green
- Solution Path is in Blue/Yellow
- Explored Nodes are in White

#### 4 action steps. Search Sequence: 
1. Up
2. Right
3. Down
4. Left

#### Start Node:(1,1) --> Goal Node:(5,5)
