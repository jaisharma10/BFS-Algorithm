# Breath First Search [BFS] Algorithm

### Task:

Implement Breath First Search [BFS] algorithm on an empty 10 x 10 map between a given start and goal node. The repository contains 2 files:

- **BFS_emptyMap.py** - The map is empty. The script finds BFS generated path between the two nodes.
- **BFS_obsMap.py** - The map has obstacles. The script finds the BFS generated path between the two nodes while avoiding obstacle space. There algorithm can be mplemented on two maps.  Set the variable 'mapNumber' to 1 or to 2 in the main function to switch between maps.
        
### Path is visualized using pygame. 
- Start Node is Red
- Goal Node is Green
- Solution Path is in Blue/Yellow
- Explored Nodes are in White

### 4 action steps. Search Sequence:

### Tree Exploration Sequence: 

BFS is a graph traversing algorithm. The traversal occurs layerwise, the neighbour nodes are visited first. The queue works on the FIFO model. The breathwise exploration is shown in the illustration below:
